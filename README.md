**Summon a Hero. Delegate your chaos.**

CampusJugaad is a gamified peer-to-peer platform designed specifically for the campus ecosystem. It empowers students to delegate everyday tasks—like standing in canteen lines, picking up lab coats, or tutoring—to fellow students who act as "**Heroes**" to earn rewards and experience points (XP).
